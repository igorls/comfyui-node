## 🎯 Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. ✅ Deterministic Workflow Hashing
- Each workflow produces consistent SHA-256 hash
- Same workflow = same hash (always)
- Different workflows = different hashes

### 2. ✅ Workflow-Level Blocking (Not Client-Level)
```
❌ Old: Client fails → entire client blocked
✅ New: Workflow fails on client → only that combo blocked
```

### 3. ✅ Smart Failover Strategy
- Tracks failures per (client, workflow-hash) pair
- Blocks with configurable cooldown (default 60s)
- Automatic unblocking after cooldown expires

### 4. ✅ Event-Based Monitoring
```typescript
pool.on("client:blocked_workflow", (ev) => { /* alert */ });
pool.on("client:unblocked_workflow", (ev) => { /* recovery */ });
pool.on("job:completed", (ev) => { /* success */ });
pool.on("job:failed", (ev) => { /* failure */ });
```

### 5. ✅ Multi-Tenant Safe Isolation
- Failures isolated per workflow
- No cross-tenant blocking
- Fair resource allocation

## 🧪 Real Server Testing

Successfully tested with real ComfyUI servers:
- `http://afterpic-comfy-patrick:8188/`
- `http://afterpic-comfy-igor:8188/`
- `http://afterpic-comfy-aero16:8188/`

**Results**:
- ✅ Connected to all 3 servers
- ✅ Enqueued 12 jobs across 3 tenants
- ✅ Detected workflow validation error on one server
- ✅ Workflow blocked on problematic server (36a03ca5...)
- ✅ System ready to route to other servers on retry
- ✅ Events fired correctly for monitoring

## ✨ Benefits

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Workflow-Level Blocking** | Minimal impact, other workflows unaffected |
| **Automatic Failover** | Intelligent routing without manual intervention |
| **Self-Healing** | Automatic recovery after cooldown |
| **Observable** | Events enable monitoring and alerting |
| **Multi-Tenant Safe** | Failures isolated per workflow |

## 🔑 Configuration Options

### Default (Production Recommended)
```typescript
new SmartFailoverStrategy({
  cooldownMs: 60_000,           // 60 second block
  maxFailuresBeforeBlock: 1     // Block on first failure
})
```

### Development (Fast Recovery)
```typescript
new SmartFailoverStrategy({
  cooldownMs: 30_000,           // 30 second block
  maxFailuresBeforeBlock: 3     // Allow 3 failures
})
```

### High Availability (Conservative)
```typescript
new SmartFailoverStrategy({
  cooldownMs: 120_000,          // 2 minute block
  maxFailuresBeforeBlock: 1     // Block immediately
})
```
